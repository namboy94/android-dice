Forgot your dice at home? No problem, you can just use Dice Roller instead!

Dice Roller allows you to roll virtual dice in different modes, allowing for multiple dice and even
completely custom number ranges.

You roll a die by tapping on it.

Animation settings and themes are accessible via the setting menu, which may be accessed via the top-right
button.
