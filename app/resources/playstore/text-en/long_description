Forgot your dice at home? Can't decide on the lottery numbers to pick?
No problem, you can just use Dice Roller instead!

Dice Roller allows you to roll virtual dice in different modes, allowing for multiple dice and even
completely custom number ranges, as well as lottery number generation with options to prefer the
most commonly drawn numbers.

Dice are rolled by tapping on them, modes are switched using the bottom bar and animation settings
and color themes are accessible via the settings menu, which may be accessed via the top-right
button.

Dice Roller is completely open source under the GPLv3 license, if you would like to check out the
